Audio Recorder is an extension that helps you easily record audio from your computer microphone. This web application is particularly useful when there is no native audio recording app on your machine, or you prefer an HTML5 app for recording audio.

Start using the app by pressing on the - Play - button. The first time you run the app, it will ask for the microphone permission to be able to record audio. Once you are done recording, press on the stop-recording button (right next to the red recording button) to stop the recording. At the end, press on the - Stop - button to turn the microphone OFF. You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
